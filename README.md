# Project Description
This project is work I have done for the Engineers Without Borders club, where I was tasked with making a housing unit for distribution of water. I was not familiar with the drawing or assembly features of Solidworks, and this porject showcases my growth and comfortability in using them.  
The structure initally had rough estimates of the size and shape of the housing unit. 

# Conclusion
This project took place over many months as there were many design changes, critiques, and difficulties coming at a weekly basis. This project improved my ability to work on a constantly fluid design, as well as use the assembly and drawing features in Solidworks.
